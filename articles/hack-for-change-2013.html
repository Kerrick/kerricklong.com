  <h2>Hack for Change 2013</h2>
  <p>I came to the first <a href="http://hackforchange.org/">National Civic Day of Hacking</a>, my first hackathon,
with no ideas and a willingness to help the community. When we broke off
into large groups to brainstorm, one thing that kept coming up was public
perception of Saint Louis, both from residents of the city and from the
nation. We mentioned things like safety, urban flight, how these things
weren’t really as bad as people thought, and how we could inform the public
that Saint Louis really is a wonderful place if you actually visit. However,
I mentioned the homelessness problem that plagues our city, not because
it was a misconception, but because it was an existing problem that gets
ignored by politicians and residents alike, except when it’s convenient.</p>

<p>Later, when we split into groups to hack away at our ideas, I championed the
idea, “Empower the homeless by using technology to provide information so
they can better their lives.” Not the catchiest title, but hopefully a noble
goal. I was joined by enough people willing to help that it became a group, and
we begun planning exactly what we could do. We thought a great mission would
be to help the homeless in three vectors: immediately, in the near future,
and over time. Immediately could include helping them find food and shelter
for today and tonight; in the near future could include helping them find work
and find counseling; and over time could include pointing them to educational
resources to broaden their skills and become more valuable in the job market.</p>

<p>About an hour into the planning, a formerly homeless citizen came into the
room and served as a wonderful source of information on the homelessness
problem from the perspective of the homeless themselves. We began asking him
how our goals aligned with the actual problems, and found out that finding
a shelter for the night was not as we had previously thought. Instead of
being first-come first-serve, in Saint Louis there is a central charity
that coordinates the areas’ shelters’ bed reservations. We called them,
and after being on hold for 18 minutes without yet talking to a human,
realized this is something we could fix in 24 hours that would really make
a difference. We spoke to the man on the line, asked what kind of details
they collected, and began designing an phone-based application.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Brian</a>, a Python developer, began working on a <a href="https://twitter.com/brianhicks">Django</a> web application
that would store shelter information such as the number of beds available, the
address, the restrictions the shelter had on who could stay, etc. <a href="https://twitter.com/henryleacock">Henry</a>, a
Java developer, began reading and learning the <a href="http://www.twilio.com/">Twilio API</a>. I, a front-end
web and UX developer, began laying out the exact steps that a user would be
taken through, and mapping that to calls to Twilio and our Django app. We worked
through the night (I took a 3-hour nap once I had laid out the process), and
by morning we had a working automated phone system that we could demo. <a href="https://twitter.com/achagani">Aslam</a>,
a developer and consultant, Sweet T, a social entrepreneur, and Suzanne, an
associate at Arch Grants, helped us develop our ideas before implementation
began, and develop our presentation after the implementation was demonstrable.</p>

<p>The demonstration went swimmingly, and people really seemed to react to
the fact that we could take an existing system, automate much of it in
such a way that it makes reserving a bed easier for the homeless, tracking
beds easier on the shelters, and staffing the phones easier on the central
charity. Plus, this system is both scalable and replicable: we could scale
it to have a national hotline with shelters across the nation participating,
or we could replicate it and let each metropolitan area have their own local
version. We ended up winning the <a href="http://hackforchange.org/rhok-saint-louis">Saint Louis National Civic Day of Hacking</a>
2013, which was extremely exciting.</p>

<p>The members of our team, <a href="http://continuumgroup.org/">Continuum Group</a>, would love to see others
continue our efforts, develop the system fully, and scale or replicate to bring
it farther than just Saint Louis, and expand so it can help homeless people
find food, find education, find counseling, and find their way out of poverty
altogether. This is just the beginning.</p>
